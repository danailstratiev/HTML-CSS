        <p>Large terrestrial mammals with trunks from Africa and Asia</p>
        <p>
        The elephants are the large mammals forming the family Elephantidae in the order Proboscidea. Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant
        (Z. evclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea;
        other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gsomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons.

        All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also called a proboscis), used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors
        grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants’ large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African
        elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

        Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be a keystone species due to their impact
        on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators, such as lions, tigers, hyenas, and any wild dogs, usually target only young elephants (or "calves”). Elephants have a
        fission—fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females ("cows") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with
        offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow.

        Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased
        testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three
        years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been
        compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.

        African elephants are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the
        ivory trade, as the animals are poached for ther ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past,
        they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion,
        literature, and popular culture.

    <h2> 
        Etymology
    </h2>
    <p>
        The word "elephant" is based on the Latin e/ephas (genitive elephantis) (“elephant”), which is the Latinised form of the Greek éé0u¢ (elephas) (genitive é2éqavt0¢ (elephantos)),[1] probably from a non-Indo-
        European language, likely Phoenician .[2] It is attested in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa (genitive e-ve-pa-to) in Linear B syllabic script.(3][4] As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek word to mean ivory,
        but after the time of Herodotus, it also referred to the animal.[1] The word "elephant" appears in Middle English as o/)faunt (c.1300) and was borrowed from Old French ofiphant (12th century).[2] Loxodonta, the
        generic name for the African elephants, 1s Greek for "oblique-sided tooth” [3]

    </p>
    <p>Elephants belong to the family Elephantidae, the sole remaining family within the order Proboscidea which belongs to the superorder Afrotheria. Their closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and
manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they share the clade Paenungulata within the superorder Afrotheria.[7] Elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade Tethytheria [8] Three species of elephants are
recognised; the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) and forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) of sub-Saharan Africa, and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) of South and Southeast Asia [9] African
elephants have larger ears, a concave back, more wrinkled skin, a sloping abdomen, and two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk. Asian elephants have smaller ears, a convex or level back, smoother skin, a
horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one extension at the tip of the trunk. The looped ridges on the molars are narrower in the Asian elephant while those of the African are more diamond-
shaped. The Asian elephant also has dorsal bumps on its head and some patches of depigmentation on its skin.[10]
